## Opening Hook

Start with the question that haunts people: "Am I spending too much?"

The anxiety of not knowing. The guilt after purchases. The vague sense that you should be doing better—but better at what, exactly?

Then the reframe: What if the question itself is wrong?

## Section 1: The Problem with Budgets

**Key points:**
- Budgets are restriction frameworks—they create anxiety by design
- The pass/fail mentality (one slip = guilt spiral)
- Frugal fatigue is real—constant denial leads to rebellion
- Budgets answer "how much can I spend?" but not "what is spending for?"

**Personal angle:** Years of failed budgeting attempts. Spreadsheets abandoned. Apps deleted. The pattern repeating.

## Section 2: A Different Question

**The reframe:**
Instead of "What's my budget?" ask "What does the life I want actually cost?"

This isn't about restriction. It's about self-knowledge.

**Key distinction:**
- Budget = external constraint imposed on yourself
- Enough number = discovered truth about what satisfies you

**The shift:** From "Am I spending too much?" (anxiety) to "Am I aligned with what I said was enough?" (clarity)

## Section 3: The Research Behind Enough

**Kahneman's satiation point:**
- Emotional wellbeing increases with income up to a point
- Beyond that point, more money doesn't mean more happiness
- The number varies by location/circumstances but exists for everyone

**The hedonic treadmill:**
- We adapt to higher spending
- The new car, bigger house—happiness boost is temporary
- Then it becomes the new baseline, and we want more
- Breaking the cycle requires awareness, not willpower

**"Your Money or Your Life" insight:**
- Money = life energy (hours traded for dollars)
- Every purchase has a cost in time, not just money
- "Is this worth X hours of my life?" changes decisions

**The synthesis:** Enough is discoverable. It's personal. And it's probably lower than you think.

## Section 4: How to Find Your Number

**Approach 1: The Quick Estimate**
- What did you spend last year? (Bank statements, rough math)
- Was that enough? Too much? Not enough in some areas?
- Adjust based on what felt right vs. what felt wasteful

**Approach 2: Build It Up (recommended)**
Walk through categories and ask: "What does good enough look like here?"

- **Housing:** Not the biggest you can afford—the one that feels like home
- **Food:** Not the cheapest—the way of eating that nourishes you
- **Transport:** Not status—what gets you where you need to go comfortably
- **Health:** Investment in future self—what keeps you well
- **Joy:** Experiences, hobbies, pleasures—what genuinely adds to your life

Sum these up. That's your enough.

**Approach 3: Values First (for deeper exploration)**
- List what matters most (family, health, security, creativity, experiences)
- For each: What spending enables it?
- For each: Where does more spending stop adding value?
- Your enough number emerges from your priorities

## Section 5: What Changes Once You Know

**Permission to spend:**
Under your enough number? You have room. That coffee, that dinner out, that small pleasure—it's within what you said was enough. No guilt required.

**Clarity when over:**
Over your enough number? You're not "bad with money." You have information. Something cost more than you planned. Now you can ask: was it worth it? Do I want to adjust?

**A living hypothesis:**
The number isn't fixed. After a few months of awareness, you might realize:
- Your enough is higher than you thought (you were depriving yourself)
- Your enough is lower than you thought (spending wasn't adding value)
- Some categories need more, others less

That's the point. You're learning what actually satisfies you.

## Section 6: The Deeper Implication

**Enough isn't just about money.**

The same question applies everywhere:
- How much work is enough?
- How much stuff is enough?
- How much achievement is enough?

Finding your enough number is practice for finding enough in general. It's a way of asking: What does a good life actually require?

Most of us have never sat with that question. We absorb cultural defaults (more is better, optimize everything, never stop striving) without examining them.

The enough number is one concrete place to start.

## Closing

**The invitation:**
You don't need another budget. You need to know what enough looks like for you.

The number might surprise you. It might change. But having it—having a clear answer to "what does my life cost?"—changes the relationship with money from anxiety to awareness.

That's the goal. Not restriction. Not optimization. Just clarity about what's enough.

## Notes for Writing

- Lead with personal experience, not theory

- Don't make it prescriptive ("10 steps to find your enough")
- Let the reader draw their own conclusions
- End with forward momentum, not a summary
